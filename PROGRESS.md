   - Add sorting options

4. **Admin Dashboard Enhancements**
   - Real-time inventory alerts
   - Sales analytics and reports
   - Customer management features

5. **Performance Optimization**

### üìù Development Notes

**Module Dependencies Fixed:**
- Previously encountered EmailService dependency issue in OrdersModule
- Fixed by ensuring EmailModule was properly imported in OrdersModule
- Same pattern applied for NotificationsModule integration

**Best Practices Followed:**
- All API endpoints have appropriate authentication guards
- Admin-only endpoints protected with RolesGuard
- Comprehensive logging with console.log statements
- Proper error handling with HTTP exceptions
- TypeORM relationships properly configured
- Service layer separation for business logic

### üîç Known Issues

1. ~~Frontend categories endpoint returning 404~~ - RESOLVED: Backend running successfully, endpoints are operational
2. ~~Frontend media endpoint returning 404~~ - RESOLVED: Backend running successfully, endpoints are operational
3. Frontend may need to verify API integration (API configuration is correct at `http://localhost:3000`)
