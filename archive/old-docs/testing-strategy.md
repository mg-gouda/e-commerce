# E-Commerce Platform – Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing approach for the e-commerce platform to ensure stability, scalability, and reliability.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Ensure all features work as expected before release.
- Catch bugs early through automated testing.
- Provide confidence during deployments via CI/CD pipeline.
- Cover both **functional** and **non-functional** requirements.

---

## 🧪 Types of Tests

### 1. Unit Tests
- **Purpose**: Validate individual functions, components, and services.  
- **Tools**:
  - **Frontend (Next.js/React)**: Jest + React Testing Library  
  - **Backend (FastAPI)**: Pytest  
- **Examples**:
  - Check product price calculation function.
  - Validate form input sanitization.
  - Test JWT token generation/validation.

---

### 2. Integration Tests
- **Purpose**: Ensure multiple components work together.  
- **Tools**:
  - Pytest (backend) with a test database (PostgreSQL test instance).  
  - React Testing Library for combined UI components.  
- **Examples**:
  - Adding a product to the cart updates cart totals.  
  - Order placement reduces product stock in DB.  
  - Admin dashboard updates product details correctly.  

---

### 3. API Tests
- **Purpose**: Validate REST API endpoints.  
- **Tools**: Postman + Newman (for CI), or Pytest with `httpx`.  
- **Examples**:
  - `/auth/register` returns token and user profile.  
  - `/products` returns paginated list with filters.  
  - `/orders` rejects unauthenticated requests.  

---

### 4. UI / Component Tests
- **Purpose**: Validate frontend user interface.  
- **Tools**: Storybook (visual testing), Jest + React Testing Library.  
- **Examples**:
  - Product card displays image, name, and price.  
  - Cart button updates count when adding products.  
  - Checkout form validates required fields.  

---

### 5. End-to-End (E2E) Tests
- **Purpose**: Simulate real user flows.  
- **Tools**: Cypress (preferred for Next.js apps).  
- **Examples**:
  - User registers, browses products, adds to cart, checks out successfully.  
  - Guest user browses and is prompted to log in at checkout.  
  - Admin logs in and updates product stock.  

---

## 🛠️ Test Environment
- **Databases**: Separate **test PostgreSQL** DB seeded with mock data.  
- **Backend**: FastAPI runs in a container with test configs.  
- **Frontend**: Next.js runs in test mode.  
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (or GitLab CI) automates test runs.  

---

## 🚦 Test Coverage
- Minimum **80% coverage** required for unit and API tests.  
- Critical paths (auth, checkout, payment) must be covered with **100% E2E tests**.  

---

## 🔄 CI/CD Integration
- On **every commit**:
  1. Run unit + integration tests.  
  2. Run API tests with mock DB.  
  3. Run UI tests (Storybook snapshot tests).  
  4. Run Cypress E2E tests before merging to `main`.  

---

## ✅ Summary
- **Unit tests** → Fast, frequent, high coverage.  
- **Integration + API tests** → Ensure backend & frontend logic aligns.  
- **UI tests** → Guarantee good user experience.  
- **E2E tests** → Validate real-world scenarios.
