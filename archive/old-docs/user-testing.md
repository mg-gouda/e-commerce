## Real-Time Error Log

During testing, the following specific errors were encountered:

### Frontend Errors (Console)
```
AxiosError: Request failed with status code 404
at async fetchCategories (src/app/products/page.tsx:48:24)

AxiosError: Request failed with status code 404
at async fetchProducts (src/app/products/page.tsx:69:24)
```

### Backend Module Loading Issue
```
[NestApplication] Nest application successfully started
[RoutesResolver] AppController {/}:
[RouterExplorer] Mapped {/, GET} route
[RoutesResolver] AuthController {/auth}:
[RouterExplorer] Mapped {/auth/register, POST} route
[RouterExplorer] Mapped {/auth/login, POST} route
[RouterExplorer] Mapped {/auth/profile, GET} route
[RouterExplorer] Mapped {/auth/forgot-password, POST} route
[RouterExplorer] Mapped {/auth/reset-password, POST} route
```

**Notable Missing Routes:**
- No ProductsController routes mapped
- No CategoriesController routes mapped
- No CartController routes mapped
- No OrdersController routes mapped

### Root Cause Analysis
The backend successfully loads only the AuthModule while other feature modules fail to initialize, despite being properly imported in app.module.ts. This suggests potential circular dependency issues, database connection problems, or missing dependencies in the other modules.
