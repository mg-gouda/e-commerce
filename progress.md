# E-Commerce Platform â€“ Development Progress

## Current Status

All frontend development tasks for Phase 3 and Phase 4 have been completed. The frontend application now includes:

*   **Core UI Components:** Navbar (responsive), Product Cards, Cart Page (responsive), and Checkout Page (responsive).
*   **Data Integration:** GraphQL queries for product catalog (using Apollo Client) and placeholder REST API services for cart, orders, and user authentication.
*   **Admin Dashboard:** A functional admin dashboard with sections for managing products (CRUD), users (CRUD), orders, and sales reports.
*   **Technical Enhancements:** Responsive UI & mobile-first design principles applied, SEO optimization with meta tags, and Dockerization for deployment.
*   **Testing:** Playwright is set up for end-to-end testing, and a basic home page test has been created.

## Recent Progress

### Phase 2: Backend (NestJS + PostgreSQL + Redis + Elasticsearch)
- [x] Integrate Elasticsearch for product search
  - Added Elasticsearch service to `docker-compose.yml`.
  - Created `ElasticsearchModule` and `ElasticsearchService` for NestJS backend.
  - Integrated `ElasticsearchModule` and `TypeOrmModule.forFeature([Product])` into `ProductsModule`.
  - Modified `ProductsService` to inject `ProductRepository` and `ElasticsearchService`, updated `findAll` and `findOne` to use the repository, and added `search`, `createProduct`, `updateProduct`, `deleteProduct` methods interacting with both DB and Elasticsearch.
  - Added `searchProducts`, `createProduct`, `updateProduct`, `deleteProduct` GraphQL mutations to `ProductsResolver`.
  - Implemented initial indexing of existing products into Elasticsearch on application startup via `ProductsModule`'s `onModuleInit`.

- [ ] Payment integration (Stripe + PayPal) - *Stripe integration partially complete*
  - Installed Stripe Node.js library.
  - Created `PaymentModule` and `PaymentService` for Stripe interactions.
  - Integrated `PaymentModule` into `AppModule` and `OrdersModule`.
  - Modified `OrdersService` to create a payment intent and return `client_secret` during order creation.
  - Updated `CreateOrderDto` and `Order` entity to support payment-related fields (`amount`, `currency`, `paymentIntentId`).
  - Created `PaymentController` to handle Stripe webhooks.
  - Modified `OrdersResolver` to return `CreateOrderResponse` (containing `Order` and `clientSecret`) for `createOrder` mutation.
  - **Pending:** Configuration of `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variables.
  - **Pending:** Integration of PayPal.
