# Code Sanitization Summary

**Date:** October 3, 2025
**Status:** Completed

---

## Overview

This document summarizes the code sanitization performed to clean up the e-commerce project codebase, removing unnecessary files, unused modules, and redundant dependencies.

---

## Files Removed

### Documentation (Moved to `/archive/old-docs/`)

The following outdated documentation files were moved to the archive:

1. `api-design.md`
2. `architecture.md`
3. `database-schema.md`
4. `devops-deployment.md`
5. `MEMORY.md` / `memory.md`
6. `mvp-scope.md`
7. `project-description.md`
8. `roadmap.md`
9. `tasks.md`
10. `testing-strategy.md`
11. `ui-wireframes.md`
12. `user-stories.md`
13. `PROGRESS.md` / `progress.md`
14. `user-testing.md`
15. `ecommerce_prompt.md`
16. `readme.md` (replaced with new `README.md`)
17. `CLAUDE.md`

**Reason:** These files were outdated, redundant, or replaced by new comprehensive documentation in `/docs/`.

---

### Test Scripts

1. `/test-cart.js` - Root-level test script
2. `/backend/create-admin.js` - Admin creation script

**Reason:** These were ad-hoc test files not part of the organized test suite.

---

### Backend Modules (Removed)

#### 1. Redis Module
- `/backend/src/redis/redis.module.ts`
- `/backend/src/redis/redis.service.ts`

**Reason:** Redis module was created but never integrated into `app.module.ts`. Not currently in use. Will be added later in Phase 4 (caching strategy).

#### 2. Elasticsearch Module
- `/backend/src/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.module.ts`
- `/backend/src/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.service.ts`

**Reason:** Elasticsearch module was created but never integrated into `app.module.ts`. Advanced search functionality not yet implemented.

#### 3. GraphQL Files
- `/backend/src/products/products.resolver.ts`
- `/backend/src/products/models/product.model.ts`
- `/backend/src/products/models/products-response.model.ts`
- `/backend/src/products/inputs/create-product.input.ts`
- `/backend/src/products/inputs/update-product.input.ts`
- `/backend/src/categories/models/category.model.ts`
- `/backend/src/auth/guards/admin.guard.ts` (GraphQL-specific)
- `/backend/src/auth/guards/roles.guard.ts` (GraphQL-specific)
- `/backend/src/auth/decorators/roles.decorator.ts`

**Reason:** Project uses REST API exclusively. GraphQL dependencies and files are not needed.

#### 4. Test Files
- `/backend/src/app.controller.spec.ts`

**Reason:** Empty spec file with no actual tests written.

---

### Frontend Components (Removed)

1. `/frontend/src/components/Navbar.tsx`

**Reason:** Unused component. `Header.tsx` is the active navigation component.

---

### Compiled/Build Artifacts

1. `/backend/dist/` - Entire compiled output folder
2. `/backend/dist/tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`

**Reason:** Build artifacts should not be committed. Will be regenerated on build.

---

## Dependencies Cleaned

### Backend package.json

**Removed Dependencies:**
- `@apollo/server` - GraphQL server (not using GraphQL)
- `@elastic/elasticsearch` - Elasticsearch client (module removed)
- `@nestjs/apollo` - GraphQL integration (not using GraphQL)
- `@nestjs/elasticsearch` - Elasticsearch integration (module removed)
- `@nestjs/graphql` - GraphQL module (not using GraphQL)
- `graphql` - GraphQL core (not using GraphQL)
- `redis` - Redis client (module removed, will add back in Phase 4)
- `sqlite3` - SQLite database (using PostgreSQL only)

**Impact:** Reduces bundle size and removes confusion about unused technologies.

---

## What Was Kept (Important Context)

### Contexts (Frontend)

Both context files were kept as they serve different purposes:

1. **SettingsContext.tsx** - Comprehensive site-wide settings (branding, email, shipping, tax, etc.)
2. **SiteSettingsContext.tsx** - UI-specific settings (product layout, colors, themes)

These are not duplicates and will be properly integrated in Phase 4.

---

## Summary Statistics

| Category | Items Removed |
|----------|---------------|
| Documentation Files | 17 |
| Test Scripts | 2 |
| Backend Modules | 2 (Redis, Elasticsearch) |
| GraphQL Files | 9 |
| Frontend Components | 1 |
| NPM Dependencies | 8 |
| **Total Files** | **31** |

---

## Next Steps

After this sanitization:

1. ✅ **Completed:** Removed unused code and dependencies
2. ⏳ **Next:** Create remaining documentation (DATABASE_SCHEMA.md, DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md)
3. ⏳ **Then:** Begin Phase 1 implementation (Image Architecture Refactor)

---

## Notes for Future Development

### Technologies Removed (May Be Added Later)

- **Redis:** Will be added in Phase 4 for caching and session management
- **Elasticsearch:** May be added in Phase 3 for advanced product search
- **GraphQL:** Not planned, but could be added as alternative API in future

### Clean Codebase Benefits

1. **Reduced Confusion:** No mixed signals about which technologies are in use
2. **Faster Builds:** Fewer dependencies to install and compile
3. **Better Type Safety:** Removed GraphQL decorators that conflicted with REST DTOs
4. **Clearer Architecture:** Only the technologies actually being used remain
